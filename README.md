# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
A wireframe is a simple visual guide that shows the structure, layout, and basic elements of a webpage or app. It focuses on **what goes where** — such as buttons, menus, images, and text — without worrying about colors, fonts, or final design details.

## Why is Wireframing Important?
Wireframing is a key step in the design process because it:

- **Clarifies ideas early:** It helps designers and stakeholders agree on the layout before development.
- **Saves time and resources:** Problems are easier to fix in a sketch than in final code or design.
- **Improves user experience (UX):** Wireframes help designers plan smooth navigation and usability before visual styling.
